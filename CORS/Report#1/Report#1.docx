Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions

There are 2 ways that it's possible to fix this problem. 
FIX 1 - It's possible to remove this access for anyone by change the source code where when someone request the Rest API and the server send a 404 (Not Found) message for the user who made the request. Reference: https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2338 
FIX 2 - It's also possible to create a rewrite rule on .htaccess (if the webserver it's Apache) to redirect any request that contain restroute (eg.: "^.restroute=/wp/") to a Not Found (404) or a Default Page.
